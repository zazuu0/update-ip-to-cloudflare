# update-ip-to-cloudflare

This script was created to update my IP addresses to Cloudflare Access.

Script will get IP address from Cloudflare Access group. It will then compare it to you current IP address. 
If there is a change it will be updated to Cloudflare Access group.

You can check your IP with 2 different interfaces if you have double WAN connection.
